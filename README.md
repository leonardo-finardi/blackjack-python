# Blackjack Game Simulation with Python

This Python project is a command line implementation of a basic blackjack game simulator. It can simulate a blackjack game with n decks and displays statistics of the hands played, including W/L ratio and cards left. It also implements card counting.

# Prerequisites

To run this program, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer.

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command to start the game:

python blackjack.py

# How to Play the Game

The game starts by asking the user to input the number of decks they want to play with.
The dealer deals two cards to the player and two cards to himself.
The player is then prompted to hit or stand. If the player hits, they receive another card.
If the player's hand value exceeds 21, they bust and lose the hand. If the dealer's hand value exceeds 21, the dealer busts and the player wins the hand. If neither busts, the hand is won by the player with the higher hand value.
